To make the icons larger and position them above all elements with absolute positioning, you can adjust the `fontSize` property in the inline styles. For the smooth animation of appearing and disappearing, you can use CSS transitions. Here's how you can modify the code:

First, let's increase the `fontSize` to make the icons bigger. You can set it to any value you prefer, but for the sake of this example, I'll set it to `96px`.

Next, to position the icons above all elements, you can wrap them in a `div` with absolute positioning and a high `z-index`.

Finally, to add smooth animations, you can use CSS transitions. You'll need to define keyframes for the appearance and disappearance animations and apply them to the icons.

Here's the updated code for the icons:

```tsx
<Flex>
  <div style={{ position: 'absolute', zIndex:  1000, opacity: resultMessage ?  1 :  0, transition: 'opacity  0.5s' }}>
    {resultMessage === "Correct!" ? (
      <CheckCircleOutlined style={{ color: "green", fontSize: "96px" }} />
    ) : resultMessage === "Incorrect. Try again." ? (
      <CloseCircleOutlined style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "96px" }} />
    ) : null}
  </div>
</Flex>
```

And here's the CSS for the keyframes (you can add this to your global CSS file or a styled component):

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity:  0;
  }
  to {
    opacity:  1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity:  1;
  }
  to {
    opacity:  0;
  }
}

.fadeIn {
  animation: fadeIn  0.5s ease-in-out;
}

.fadeOut {
  animation: fadeOut  0.5s ease-in-out;
}
```

You'll need to dynamically apply the `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` classes based on whether the `resultMessage` is changing. You can use the `useEffect` hook to listen for changes to `resultMessage` and apply the classes accordingly.

Here's an example of how you might do that:

```tsx
const [iconClass, setIconClass] = useState('');

useEffect(() => {
  if (resultMessage) {
    setIconClass('fadeIn');
    setTimeout(() => setIconClass('fadeOut'),  2000); // Adjust the timeout to control the duration of the icon's appearance
  } else {
    setIconClass('');
  }
}, [resultMessage]);

// ...

<Flex>
  <div style={{ position: 'absolute', zIndex:  1000, opacity: resultMessage ?  1 :  0, transition: 'opacity  0.5s' }} className={iconClass}>
    {resultMessage === "Correct!" ? (
      <CheckCircleOutlined style={{ color: "green", fontSize: "96px" }} />
    ) : resultMessage === "Incorrect. Try again." ? (
      <CloseCircleOutlined style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "96px" }} />
    ) : null}
  </div>
</Flex>
```

Make sure to import `useEffect` from React if you haven't already:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
```

Please note that the `setTimeout` function is used to control the duration of the icon's appearance. You can adjust the timeout value to suit your needs. The `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` classes are applied based on the state of `resultMessage`.

Remember to add the CSS keyframes to your global styles or a styled component to ensure the animations work correctly.
